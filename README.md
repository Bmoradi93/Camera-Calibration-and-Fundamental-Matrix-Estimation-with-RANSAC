# Camera-Calibration-and-Fundamental-Matrix-Estimation-with-RANSAC
The goal of this repository is to introduce you to camera and scene geometry. Specifically I will estimate the camera projection matrix, which maps 3D world coordinates to image coordinates, as well as the fundamental matrix, which relates points in one scene to epipolar lines in another. The camera projection matrix and the fundamental matrix can each be estimated using point correspondences. To estimate the projection matrix (camera calibration), the input is corresponding 3d and 2d points. To estimate the fundamental matrix the input is corresponding 2d points across two images. I will start out by estimating the projection matrix and the fundamental matrix for a scene with ground truth correspondences. Then I'll move on to estimating the fundamental matrix using point correspondences from ORB, which is an alternative to SIFT.
